From the book: Python Workout: Fifty short projects!

In guess.py:
Write a program that chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive). Then ask the user to guess what number has been chosen. Each time the user enters a guess, the program indicates one of:

Too high
Too low
Just right

If the user guessed correctly, then the program exits. Otherwise, the user is asked to try again.
The program only exits after the user guesses correctly.


In guess_word.py:
Have the program choose a random word from the dictionary, and then ask the user to guess the word. (You might want to limit yourself to words containing between 2-5 letters, to avoid making it too horribly diffciult.) Instead of telling the user that they should guess a smaller or larger number, have them choose an earlier or later word in the dictionary.
